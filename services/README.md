# Cloud Services

The `services/` directory contains every deployable backend workload that powers
Beacon. Each subdirectory is a Spring Boot microservice with its own Dockerfile,
infrastructure configuration, and Gradle module.

Current services:

- `rest-officials/` &mdash; REST APIs consumed by the mobile application and web clients.
- `auth-service/` &mdash; Authentication endpoints that issue and validate session tokens.
- `sse-service/` &mdash; Server-Sent Events publisher used for live update streams.
- `ingest-usa-fed/` &mdash; Ingestion pipeline that captures U.S. federal legislative data.

## Adding a new service

1. Scaffold a new folder inside `services/` and copy the Gradle + Docker
   scaffolding from an existing module as a starting point.
2. Register the module in `settings.gradle.kts` (following the
   `services:<module-name>` convention).
3. Update `docker-compose.yml` if the service should run in the local stack and
   provide a dedicated Dockerfile in the module directory.
4. Keep the moduleâ€™s README or comments up to date with runtime expectations,
   environment variables, and any external integrations.

By keeping every backend service under a single directory, we maintain a
consistent structure for local development, CI pipelines, and deployment
tooling.
