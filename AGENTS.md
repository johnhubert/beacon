# UI Conventions

Prefer TypeScript and React Native for UI. Always use latest available libraries, check that you are using
the latest, upgrade to latest if not. Use a hot reload mechanism using Metro Go to allow for testing ios
and android on the local network.

# Backend Conventions

Use springboot and latest java version for backend microservices

# General Conventions

NEVER check in any secrets, keys, etc
